    text: "Just finished leading a red team exercise simulating an advanced persistent threat attack, and wow, the results were eye-opening. The team exploited weaknesses not through fancy zero-days but through simple misconfigurations and poor credential hygiene. For example, 3 admins were reusing the same password across multiple services â€” once breached, it opened up lateral movement like wildfire. Even scarier, sensitive documents werenâ€™t encrypted at rest, meaning anyone with access could extract them directly. This is 2025, and we still underestimate the basics. The lesson for me wasnâ€™t about needing the newest AI-driven defense systems â€” it was about doubling down on fundamentals like password rotation, least privilege, encryption, and regular auditing. It made me realize that most breaches donâ€™t happen because hackers are geniuses, but because companies are lazy about basics. If youâ€™re running security teams, please: patch systems, train users, and never assume youâ€™re too small to be a target. Cybersecurity is only as strong as the weakest overlooked practice, and in our case, that nearly cost millions.",
